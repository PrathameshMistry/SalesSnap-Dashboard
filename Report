14. Algorithm: Sales Data Analysis Model   
To demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of the 'SalesSnap Dashboard Analyzer Model,' I can 
include the following:  
1. Basic Visualizations on Real-World or Augmented Data: 
• Visualizations: 
o Bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and custom gauges. 
o Visualize key metrics like total sales, monthly performance, and KPIs. 
Python code : 
import streamlit as st 
import pandas as pd 
import plotly.express as px 
import plotly.graph_objects as go 
import duckdb 
# Load data 
@st.cache_data 
def load_data(path): 
return pd.read_excel(path) 
data = load_data('https://github.com/PrathameshMistry/SalesSnap
Dashboard/blob/main/Financial%20Data%20Clean.xlsx') 
# Data Preview 
st.title("SalesSnap Dashboard") 
st.dataframe(data) 
# Basic Visualizations 
st.subheader("Sales by Month") 
fig = px.bar(data, x='Month', y='Sales') 
st.plotly_chart(fig) 
st.subheader("Sales by Product") 
fig = px.pie(data, names='Product', values='Sales') 
st.plotly_chart(fig) 
2.Simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
• EDA: Perform basic statistical analysis and visualize distributions, correlations, and trends. 
• Python code : 
st.subheader("Exploratory Data Analysis") 
# Summary Statistics 
st.write(data.describe()) 
# Correlation Matrix 
st.write("Correlation Matrix") 
correlation_matrix = data.corr() 
st.write(correlation_matrix) 
# Distribution of Sales 
st.subheader("Distribution of Sales") 
fig = px.histogram(data, x='Sales') 
st.plotly_chart(fig) 
3.Machine Learning Modelling: 
• ML Model: Implement a simple predictive model to forecast future sales. 
• Python code : 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression 
# Prepare data 
data['Month_num'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Month'], format='%b').dt.month 
X = data[['Month_num']] 
y = data['Sales'] 
# Split data 
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) 
# Train model 
model = LinearRegression() 
model.fit(X_train, y_train) 
# Predict 
y_pred = model.predict(X_test) 
# Display predictions 
st.subheader("Sales Predictions") 
prediction_df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred}) 
st.write(prediction_df)
